I’m Jeremy Brown, a methodical and solution‑focused software architect with more than two decades of experience designing and building scalable, high‑performance systems. Over the course of my career, I’ve led the architecture and development of enterprise platforms that power thousands of deployments worldwide—most notably at Acre Security, where I served as Chief Software Architect for over 20 years.

My expertise spans the full software development lifecycle, from backend services and APIs to modern web frontends and cloud‑native deployments. I specialize in .NET, C#, Blazor, Docker, and identity frameworks, with a proven track record of creating modular, future‑proof solutions that balance robustness, usability, and performance.

I thrive at the intersection of system design and hands‑on engineering—whether it’s rewriting a mission‑critical API from the ground up, integrating real‑time event systems, or optimizing infrastructure to squeeze every bit of throughput from hardware and networks. Beyond the technical details, I’m passionate about building tools that are not only powerful but also intuitive, enabling developers and end‑users alike to succeed.

Outside of work, I’m a husband and proud father of two boys. Family is at the center of my life, and I enjoy spending time outdoors with them—whether it’s fishing, exploring, or simply being together. That balance between deep technical focus and meaningful personal time keeps me grounded and inspired in everything I do.
